# Payzee MVP - Solana Payment Gateway

## Overview

Payzee is a next-generation payment gateway that enables seamless integration with the Solana blockchain. Our MVP demonstrates the core functionality required for merchants to accept Solana-based payments securely and efficiently.

## Key Features Implemented

### 1. Merchant Authentication
- Secure signup/signin with JWT tokens
- Password hashing with bcrypt (12 rounds)
- Token expiration for enhanced security

### 2. Project Management
- Merchants can create and manage multiple projects
- Each project has its own configuration
- Unique API keys per merchant for transaction processing

### 3. Transaction Processing
- Generate temporary Solana accounts for each transaction
- Secure API key verification for transaction initiation
- Real-time transaction verification on Solana blockchain
- Automatic status updates in the database

### 4. Security Measures
- API keys are hashed with salt before storage
- Public key validation to prevent invalid addresses
- Secure JWT implementation with expiration
- Environment-based configuration for different deployment stages

### 5. Developer Experience
- Comprehensive API documentation
- Clear error messages and validation
- Consistent response formats
- Health check endpoints

## Technical Architecture

### Backend Stack
- **Node.js** with Express.js framework
- **PostgreSQL** with Prisma ORM for data persistence
- **Solana Web3.js** for blockchain interactions
- **Zod** for request validation
- **JWT** for authentication
- **Bcrypt** for password hashing

### Key Components
1. **Authentication Service**: Handles merchant registration and login
2. **Project Management Service**: Manages merchant projects and configurations
3. **Transaction Service**: Processes payments and verifies blockchain transactions
4. **Security Layer**: Implements API key verification and JWT authentication

## API Endpoints

### Authentication
```
POST /api/v1/user/signup
POST /api/v1/user/signin
```

### Project Management
```
POST /api/v1/user/project
GET /api/v1/user/project[?projectId=xyz]
PUT /api/v1/user/ (generate new API keys)
```

### Transaction Processing
```
POST /api/v1/transaction
```

## Security Implementation

### Data Protection
- All passwords hashed with bcrypt (12 rounds)
- API keys hashed with salted SHA-256
- JWT tokens with 24-hour expiration
- Environment-specific secrets management

### Transaction Security
- Temporary Solana accounts for each transaction
- Real-time blockchain verification
- Automatic status updates
- Input validation at every layer

## Scalability Considerations

### Current Implementation
- Singleton database connections
- Asynchronous operations throughout
- Efficient error handling
- Modular code structure

### Future Scalability
- Can be easily containerized with Docker
- Stateless architecture supports horizontal scaling
- Database connection pooling ready
- Caching layer can be added with Redis

## Getting Started

1. **Setup Environment**
   ```bash
   cp .env.example .env
   # Update .env with your configuration
   ```

2. **Database Migration**
   ```bash
   npm run migrate
   ```

3. **Start Development Server**
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

4. **API Usage**
   - Create a merchant account
   - Generate API keys
   - Create a project
   - Initiate transactions using API keys

## Roadmap

### Short Term (Next 3 months)
- Webhook notifications for transaction status
- Dashboard for merchants
- Enhanced analytics
- Rate limiting implementation

### Medium Term (3-6 months)
- Support for additional Solana wallets
- Multi-currency support
- Advanced reporting features
- Mobile SDKs

### Long Term (6+ months)
- Cross-chain payment support
- Smart contract integration
- Advanced fraud detection
- Compliance tools (PCI DSS, etc.)

## Why Payzee?

1. **Low Transaction Fees**: Leveraging Solana's low-cost infrastructure
2. **High Performance**: Sub-second transaction confirmations
3. **Developer-Friendly**: Simple integration with comprehensive documentation
4. **Secure by Design**: Multiple layers of security for merchant and customer data
5. **Scalable Architecture**: Built to handle high transaction volumes
6. **Web3 Native**: Designed specifically for the decentralized economy

## Target Market

- E-commerce platforms looking to accept cryptocurrency
- DeFi applications requiring payment processing
- Gaming platforms with in-app purchases
- Subscription services wanting crypto payments
- Any business wanting to leverage blockchain payments

## Competitive Advantage

- **Technical**: Solana's speed and low fees vs. Ethereum's high gas fees
- **Business**: Simpler integration than traditional payment gateways
- **Market Timing**: Growing adoption of Solana ecosystem
- **Focus**: Specialized for Solana vs. generic crypto payment processors
